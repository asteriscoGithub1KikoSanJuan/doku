Upgrade all the packages on your server to be able to install everything correctly

sudo su

apt-get update

apt-get upgrade

Install wget or curl if you didn't install it bedore (usually both these packages are installed by default but sometimes they are not)

apt-get install wget

This package will allow you to avoid errors connected with gem native extensions and make command

apt-get install ruby-dev
apt-get install make g++ gcc libssl-dev

Download the package from bitnami.com

wget https://bitnami.com/redirect/to/51732/bitnami-redmine-2.6.3-0-linux-x64-installer.run

Add needed permissions and make the installer executable

chmod +x  bitnami-redmine-2.6.3-0-linux-x64-installer.run

Run the installer

./bitnami-redmine-2.6.3-0-linux-x64-installer.run

Wail till package will be installed. It will ask some questions, you will need to answer them.

Open in your browser

http://localhost:80

to check that redmine is working correctly.

Now we may install plugins.

cd /opt/redmine-2.6.3-0/apps/redmine/htdocs/plugins

copy plugins here

As an example I will use CRM (Contacts) plugin PRO version.

unzip redmine_contacts-3.4.5-pro.zip

cd ../../../
./use_redmine
cd apps/redmine/htdocs

To avoid gem freezes during installation use option --no-deployment

bundle install --without development test --no-deployment

Then create new databases and migrate data

bundle exec rake redmine:plugins NAME=redmine_contacts RAILS_ENV=production

and restart the application

sudo /opt/redmine-2.6.3-0/ctlscript.sh restart

Now you may check that plugin is installed and working correctly.

The same steps will be correct if you try to install bitnami redmine stack 3.0.1-0.
