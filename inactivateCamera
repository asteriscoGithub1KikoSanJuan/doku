Cameras are controlled by the uvcvideo kernel module.

You can disable the camera until reboot by opening a terminal and typing 
			sudo modprobe -r uvcvideo. 

You will be asked for your password, and after typing it, if there are no 
errors shown in the terminal, your webcam should be disabled.

If you got the error message: modprobe: FATAL: Module uvcvideo is in use. 
after trying to remove the uvcvideo module, you can try to force its removal 
with the following: 
			sudo rmmod -f uvcvideo 
(thanks thiagowfx)

To enable your webcam again, type 
			sudo modprobe uvcvideo 
into terminal.

If you want the camera to be disabled when you reboot, then press 
			ALT+F2 
and paste this command:

			gksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

You will be asked for your password. After giving it, a text file should open. 
Paste at the end of the text file on a new line:

			blacklist uvcvideo

Then save the file and exit. Next time you start Ubuntu, the webcam should be disabled.
