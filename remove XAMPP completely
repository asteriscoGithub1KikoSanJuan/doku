This should remove XAMPP completely as they provide the uninstaller files in /opt/lampp/

 sudo chmod +x /opt/lampp/uninstall
 sudo /opt/lampp/uninstall

Then you can make sure the unistallation is complete by doing user318149's answer above. cheers

sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop 
sudo rm -rf /opt/lampp and 
rm -rf ~/.lampp 
(Log files) did it for me. 
There is no Lampp/Xampp related configs/logs in ~/.cache or ~/.local/share
	

Lampp actually have an uninstaller files in /opt/lampp/named unintaller. Just change the mode using this command

    cd /opt/lampp/ to enter the directory
    sudo chmod +x uninstaller to change it into executable file
    ./uninstaller to run the unistaller file


You can uninstall Xampp in ubuntu by going to terminal: Ctrl + Alt + T then type:

cd /opt/lampp
sudo ./uninstall

then you get the xampp uninstaller and you can uninstall xampp. but, there are some leftover file in the lampp folder to remove it just type in terminal:

sudo rm -r /opt/lampp

Now xampp is removed completely.

This is the full code to uninstall lampp..

sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop
sudo chmod +x /opt/lampp/uninstall
sudo /opt/lampp/uninstall
sudo rm -R /opt/lampp

The default directory for XAMPP is “opt/lampp”.

Open the terminal and type

sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop 

after this type

sudo rm -rf /opt/lampp
